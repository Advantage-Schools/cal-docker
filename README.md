# calendso-docker
The Docker configuration for Calendso is an effort powered by people within the community. Calendso does not provide official support for Docker, but we will accept fixes and documentation. Use at your own risk.

## Requirements
Make sure you have `docker` & `docker-compose` installed on the server / system.

    cd calendso-docker
    ```
4. Update `.env` if needed 

5. Build and start calendso

    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
